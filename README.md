# Python examples for OpenStuder client

## datalog-gui  

Simple GUI application to plot or download logged property values from an OpenStuder gateway. *tkinter* based. Tested to work on Ubuntu Linux and macOS, whereby it looks terrible on macOS Big Sur due to incompatibilities of tkinter with the new look and feel of macOS.
